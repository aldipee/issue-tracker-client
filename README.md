React Query provides easy-to-use features for :

- Window focus pre-fetching mechanism to pre-fetch the data depending on application tab activity.
- Set the number of request retries for any request, in case of random errors.
- React-Query performs pre-fetching so that the application can update stale data in the background.

- Optimistic UI
